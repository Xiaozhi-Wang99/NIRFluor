# NIRFluor
We have established a predictor of NIR small molecule fluorophores, NIRFluor, to predict six optical properties of a given NIR organic small molecule in different solvents with different ratios, including absorption wavelength (λabs), emission wavelength (λemi), stokes shift, extinction coefficient (lgε), quantum yield (Φ), and lifetime (τ).
